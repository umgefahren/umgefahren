### Hi there 👋
I'm Hannes

☮️ he/him

💻 I'm studying computer science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

🦀 I'm programming mainley in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and I'm particularly interested in [Web3](https://web3.foundation/about/).

🔒 My most proudest project is [dione](https://github.com/Dione-Software/dione) a dezenteralized messaging system. Still in development, although I don't really have the time. ~> I look for a collaborator for this project. 

🌱 I'm currently learning [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) and [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). But Rust is and stays the best programming language!

I feel like home in: 🇩🇪 / 🇨🇭 / 🇪🇺
