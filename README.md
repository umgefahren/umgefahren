💻 I'm studying computer science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

🔒 My proudest project is [dione](https://github.com/Dione-Software/dione) a dezenteralized messaging system. Still in development, although I don't really have the time. ~> I look for a collaborator for this project. 

🌐 I'm a contributer to [rust-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p).

💼 I'm a cofounder and lead-developer at my Startup Nautilus Smart Systems.

I like sailing ⛵️ and photography 📷🎞️ and tae 🐻
